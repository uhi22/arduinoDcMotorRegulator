# Motor regulator for small DC motors

## Features:

* 12V input from power supply
* Motor voltage generation with PWM
* Measurement of motor voltage and motor current
* Constant speed control based on generated voltage
* Poti (pedal) input for target speed setting
* Thermo model of the motor, power reduction to prevent overheating

## Hardware

Arduino Nano, stepdown-converter with N-channel-FET.
KiCad schematics and board included
